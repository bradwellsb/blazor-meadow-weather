# Blazor and IOT
This sample project was created by [Bradley Wells](https://wellsb.com/csharp/) to demonstrate a technique for sending data from connected IoT hardware to a web API. In this sample, a Meadow microcontroller polls data from a LM35 temperature sensor. That data is sent via HTTP request to an API controller endpoint and stored in a database where it can be visualized in a chart using a Blazor web app.
